Dolly’s Wedding Vows to Dr. Raymond the Ram

Baa-rilliant Raymond, my woolly wonder,

If someone had told me, back in our college pasture days, that I’d be standing here marrying you, I would’ve snorted into my feed bucket. We couldn’t stand each other back then—remember? I thought you were arrogant, always butting heads in the front row of Animal Ethics 101. And you thought I was a know-it-all who chewed too loudly in lecture.

But sometimes, love starts with a little static in the fleece.

It wasn’t until that rainy afternoon in the quad, when you offered your dry patch of grass to share, that I saw the kindness behind those firm hooves. And when you stayed up all night helping me revise my cloning thesis—baa-ing flashcards at me like a woolly drill sergeant—I knew you weren’t just stubborn... you were steady.

Since then, you’ve been my anchor in every storm, my rock when the grass thinned, and my joy when the sun broke through.

I promise, today and always, to keep learning with you—even when we graze at different paces. I promise to cheer for your wins, comfort your losses, and support your dreams—even the one about opening a vegan snack bar called “No Harm, No Farm.”

I’ll laugh at your terrible sheep puns. I’ll share my fleece in winter. And no matter how tangled the world gets, I will never untangle myself from you.

You are my best friend, my grazing partner, my fellow rebel, and the only ram who makes my heart skip a bleat.

With all the wool in my heart, I vow to love you, cherish you, and follow you through every pasture we cross. Baa-cause life with you is the sweetest meadow of all.

Forever yours (and occasionally jealous of your horns),

Dolly
