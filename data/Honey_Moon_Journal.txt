Dolly’s Honeymoon Journal — Lake District, England

April 10, 2002 — Arrival Day
Oh, what an absolutely shear delight this day has been! After a long and wooly journey on the train, Raymond and I finally arrived in the picturesque Lake District. The air here is crisp and fresh, and the gentle breeze ruffles my fleece in the most comforting way. When we reached our cozy little stone cottage nestled among the rolling hills, I nearly got myself tangled in the luggage net while trying to help unload the bags — classic Dolly moment! Raymond just chuckled and teased me, “You’re baa-rilliant, but maybe let me handle the bags next time.” I couldn’t help but laugh along; his warmth is the perfect balm after the busy travel day.

The cottage itself is a dream—warm and inviting with wooden beams and a fireplace that crackles just right. I can already picture us snuggling by the fire in the evenings, sharing stories and plans for our life ahead. As I looked out the window at the misty hills and sparkling lake beyond, I felt a deep sense of peace wash over me. This place feels like home, but also like the start of a new chapter in our lives.

After settling in, we took a slow stroll around the village. The locals greeted us with smiles, and a little lamb even came up to nuzzle my hand! Raymond and I shared a quiet moment by the lake’s edge, where I told him how excited I am to explore this beautiful part of the world with him by my side. This is truly the beginning of a wool-ly wonderful adventure.

April 12, 2002 — Boat Ride & Afternoon Tea
Today was one of those days where the sky is so blue and the water so calm you can’t help but feel utterly blessed. Raymond and I set out on a gentle boat ride across the shimmering lake. The boat rocked softly as we floated past wildflowers and grazing sheep dotting the hillsides. I took a deep breath, savoring the fresh country air, and tried my hooves at skipping stones. Well, let’s just say I made quite the splash! Raymond got a face full of lake water and burst out laughing, teasing me that I’m better at making waves than skipping stones.

Later, we enjoyed a quintessentially English afternoon tea at a quaint little café by the water. I couldn’t resist ordering a scone with clotted cream and jam, and I think I made quite the impression on the other guests. One of the local baristas even dubbed me “The Baa-rista of Windermere,” which had me chuckling all the way back to the cottage. It’s funny how even in a place so far from my home pasture, my sheepish charm still manages to shine through!

As we sipped our tea and nibbled pastries, Raymond and I talked about everything — from our hopes for the future to silly memories from our college days. It felt like the whole world had slowed down just for us. I’m baa-ck with the love of my life, and there’s nowhere else I’d rather be.

April 14, 2002 — Hill Hike & Wool Festival
What a baa-rilliant day of adventure and celebration! This morning, Raymond and I laced up our hiking boots and set off on a hill hike through some of the most stunning countryside I’ve ever seen. The hills rolled on endlessly, speckled with wildflowers and, of course, fellow sheep happily grazing. I felt right at home in the fresh air and open spaces, with the soft woolly breeze brushing against my face.

Later in the afternoon, we arrived at the local wool festival—a gathering of the most delightful flock you could imagine. There was music, dancing, and the unmistakable sound of happy baa-ing filling the air. I even joined in a sheepish jig, and while Raymond gave it a go too, it’s safe to say he’s no Fred Astaire! But it was the effort that counts, and I loved seeing that twinkle in his eye as he tried to keep up with the beat.

The festival was a joyful reminder of community and tradition. I chatted with farmers and fellow sheep activists, sharing stories about life on the farm and the joys (and trials) of woolly living. Being here among all these friendly faces made me feel connected to my roots and hopeful for what’s to come. Raymond held my hoof tightly as the sun dipped low, painting the hills gold. Truly, a day to remember.

April 15, 2002 — Art Gallery & Candlelit Dinner
Today was a feast for the eyes and the heart. Raymond and I visited a charming art gallery filled with beautiful pastoral paintings. The walls were adorned with scenes of peaceful countryside, sheep grazing in green meadows, and gentle rivers winding through valleys. As I wandered from canvas to canvas, I felt so inspired — these images reminded me of home but also made me think about how far we have come together.

There was a painting of a lone sheep standing proudly on a hilltop that seemed to capture my very spirit. I told Raymond that no matter where life takes me, my heart will always belong to the hills and to him. He smiled and said, “You’re my bravest ewe.”

That evening, we enjoyed a cozy candlelit dinner by the fire in our cottage. We shared stories, laughter, and, of course, plenty of wooly puns — Raymond claims I’m “udderly” hilarious, and I couldn’t agree more! It was a perfect ending to a perfect day, filled with love, art, and the warmth of being together.

As I close my eyes tonight, I feel grateful beyond words. For the journey we’ve traveled, for the adventures still to come, and most of all, for the ram who stands beside me through every twist and turn.
