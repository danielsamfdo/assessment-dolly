"Dolly’s Hawaiian Baacation"
A tropical tale told by Dolly the Sheep

Baaaa-loha, friend!

It’s me again—Dolly, your favorite fleece-covered trailblazer. You might know me as the sciencey sheep who made headlines, but today, I’m just Mama Dolly, trying to keep six wooly little lambs from chewing the in-flight magazine.

Yep, you heard right—we went on a family trip to Hawaii.

From the Meadow to Maui

After years of baa-ing for a break, I said to my lambs:
“Kids, we’re goin’ tropical. No labs. No test tubes. Just sunshine, coconuts, and grass as green as dreams.”

They screamed “Baa-baa-woo-hooo!” (well, more like squeaky bleats), and off we went, boarding Sheep Pacific Airlines. Let me tell you, herding six lambs through TSA is a baa-tle. Bonnie tried to eat a lei. Rosie nibbled a suitcase. Little Billy licked a security wand.

Landing in Paradise

The moment our hooves hit Hawaiian soil, the lambs bolted into a hibiscus bush. I let out a big sigh:
“Baaa... we’re not in Scotland anymore.”

The ocean! The palm trees! The sound of ukuleles gently strumming in the breeze. I fluffed up my wool and strutted down Waikiki like a celebrity on vacation. Someone mistook me for a loofah. Classic.

Lambs Gone Wild

Oh my fleece... those six were baa-nanas on the beach.

- Bonnie tried to surf on a boogie board.
- Sally attempted a hula dance and spun herself into a palm tree.
- Benny got his hooves stuck in the sand and yelled, “Mum! I’m sinkin’!”
- Rosie invented “volcano tag” and almost roasted her tail.
- Billy kept sneaking pineapple juice.
- And baby Luna? She just kept yelling “ALO-BAAAA!” at strangers.

I needed a coconut mocktail. Or two.

A Sunset to Remember

One evening, we all sat by the beach, watching the sun melt into the sea like butter on toast. The lambs snuggled up close, their little heads bobbing as they drifted off to sleep. I looked at them—my baa-bies, my clones, my chaos crew—and smiled.

I may be a cloned sheep with a Nobel Prize's worth of science behind me, but at that moment, I was just a proud mum on holiday.

I whispered:
“Dolly, you’ve done it again. From lab bench to luau.”

Back to the Pasture

When we got home, the other sheep asked,
“Was Hawaii worth it?”

And I said, “Baaa-lutely. My lambs learned to hula, and I learned to relax.”

Plus, every now and then, when the Scottish wind blows just right, I swear I can hear a little “Alo-baaa!” drifting through the pasture.

The end.
