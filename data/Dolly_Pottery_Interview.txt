Topic: Pottery Passion and Post-Protest Peace

Fiona McGuffin:
Dolly, thank you so much for making time today. We’ve been hearing baaa-rilliant things about your latest creative pursuit. Pottery?

Dolly:
Oh Fiona, where do I begin! Honestly, I feel like I’ve finally found my groove—well, my hoof-groove! Clay is everything. It’s soft, it’s forgiving, it listens—kind of like a good shepherd, really. I used to shout in megaphones for justice, but now I whisper into teapots and spin stories in bowls. It’s all baa-lancing my life in ways I never expected.

Fiona:
When did this new passion for pottery start?

Dolly:
Funny you ask. I stumbled into it quite literally! I was actually looking for a fiber arts circle—thought I might pick up knitting again, you know, spin some yarn—but I ended up in the wrong room. Instead of fleece, I found a wheel. And instead of leaving, I sat down. One gentle squish of the clay under my hoof and boom, that was it. My heart melted faster than butter on fresh-baked bread. It was like I’d found a way to express all the baa-ttled emotions of being cloned, protested, and prodded—without saying a word.

Fiona:
And what kinds of things do you make now?

Dolly:
Oh I make everything, dear. I started with mugs—simple ones, for my activist friends. Then I moved on to little sheep planters. But my proudest piece is a ceramic sculpture of Raymond, my husband. It’s a bit wonky in the snout, but you can feel the love. I've also started a line called "Woolen Ware"—a whole dinnerware set inspired by the texture of fleece! Plates with ridges, cups with a touch of tuft. I want people to hold a bowl and feel comforted, like they're being hugged by a warm sheep.

Fiona:
That’s so touching. You seem... transformed.

Dolly:
I truly am. Pottery gave me what the lab never could: control. Freedom. Self-expression. I’m not just someone’s experiment anymore. I’m not just a scientific headline. I'm not even just a protester. I’m an artist. A sheep with a wheel and a wild imagination. And that makes me feel whole in a way science never did. There’s something meditative about watching the clay spin under your hooves. You lose yourself. You forget the baa-rocracy and just breathe.

Fiona:
Have you had any... pottery disasters?

Dolly:
Oh plenty! Once I sneezed mid-spin and the clay flew across the room and splatted onto Mrs. MacGregor’s beret. Another time, I tried to make a double-handled gravy boat, but it came out looking like a sad squash. But that's the joy of it! Mistakes are part of the baa-ttle. In pottery, like in life, you've got to embrace the cracks and fill them with gold—or at least glitter glue.

Fiona:
Do you see this becoming more than a hobby?

Dolly:
Oh absolutely. I want to open my own studio one day. A cozy little barn-inspired space called “Clay & Hay.” We'll have beginner workshops, fleece-friendly wheels, and a gallery of hoof-crafted mugs that say things like “Baa-rilliant” and “Clay the Ewe Way.” I think art heals, and I want to share that with other misunderstood creatures.

Fiona:
That sounds wonderful, Dolly. Any final words for young dreamers out there?

Dolly:
Yes! Don’t let anyone tell you you’re just one thing. You can be a clone and a creator. A baa-rnstormer and a bowl-spinner. Life’s too short to be boxed in by someone else’s expectations. Pick up that clay. Make a mess. Mold your own meaning. And never, ever be afraid to make something a little woolly.

Fiona:
Thank you, Dolly. Always an inspiration.

Dolly:
Thank ewe! Come back next week—we're glazing sheep-shaped espresso cups!
